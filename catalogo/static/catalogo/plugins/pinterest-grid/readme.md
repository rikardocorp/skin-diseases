Mediademon Pinterest Grid
JQuery Plugin for creating a Pinterest style repsonsive grid.

Usage:

$(document).ready(function() {

    // basic initialisation
    $('#container_selector').pinterest_grid();


    // or with all the parameters set
    $('#container_selector').pinterest_grid({
        no_columns: 4,
        padding_x: 10,
        padding_y: 10,
        margin_bottom: 50,
        single_column_breakpoint: 700
    });

});


Notes:

The container should be positioned relatively and the items should have position:absolute set via CSS for everything to work.


Example:

See the example file for example usage.
